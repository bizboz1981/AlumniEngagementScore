# AlumniEngagementScore
This project is to build a simple app that will read in a spreadsheet containing summarised (aggregate) data from an alumni database. Such datapoints may include number of hours volunteered, number of emails opened, number of links clicked as well as other data indicative of engagement.
Initially the app will allow the user to choose the weighting they would like to apply to each data point and then calculate the overall score.
Extensions to the project over time will include:
  - Python script to generate the input file in a standard format
  - More easily output a csv file
